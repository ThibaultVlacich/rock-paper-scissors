# Rock, Paper, Scissors
This project demonstrates a web application that allows the user to play _Rock, Paper, Scissors_ against a web server.

The back-end consists of a simple REST API made with Spring Boot, and the Front-End is a reactive application.

## Run the application
To run the application, it is just needed to run the following command while in the project directory:

```
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```

Do not run `npm install` before as it will be automatically done in a controlled environment (with a specific version of node and npm).
Running it manually could compile some packages with a different version of node and could be incompatible.
